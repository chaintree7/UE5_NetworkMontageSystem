# Event-Driven Network Montage System 

### This is a lightweight component, it simplifies the Montage RPC process and use events to handle Montage's logic
#### In the example, includes `weapon switching` & `attack` & `combo` & `hitreact` & `weapon trails` & `weapon hit trace`


## Usage
#### Add component `CT_Cmpt_Montage` to any Actor, such as `BP_Weapon`, `BP_Character`, `BP_Ability`, etc.

#### Regular Montage RPC

#### RPC in MontageSystem
#### And also fixed the bug that StartingPosition is not works when specifies StartingSection

# Network Options

## NetworkPriority
#### `None`: No replication
#### `Server`: Montage will be played on the server first and then multicast to all clients
#### `OwningClient`: montage will be played on the OwningClient first, then played on Server, and finally Multicast to other Clients

## NetworkDelayOffset 
#### If True, When network is bad, Other clients will skip the delayed time
#### For example, you played a 1-second Montage (`NetworkPriority=OwningClient`), and another client network delay is 0.5-second. this client will saw your montage is played starting from 0.5. This will ensure that other clients are at the same progress as your montage



# Handle `Notify` in `Actor`
#### I prefer to handle Notify in Actor instead of creating `BP_Notify` files because in `Actor` can easily modify values ​​and change resource files at runtime.
#### In the example. I created a BP_Weapon that handles `Combo` & `Weapon Trails` & `HitTrace` notifies, and then used `Child Class` to change Trails FX. I think this way is more flexible and clean. This is just optional, you can also use BP_Notify if you want

#### using the built-in `MontageNotify` and `MontageNotifyWindow`.

#### Then handle Notifys through the component's Events. This way, all the logic of the Montage can be kept in one BP_Actor

#### There is a useful function `NotifyStartsWith?` in the component. It's used to split NotifyName and allowing you to simply handle complex Notify

# Other Events

#### In short, they are events within PlayMontage.
